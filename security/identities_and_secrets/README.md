# Scope
1. Identity and Secrets:
    - Identity refers to the set of attributes that define an entity (user, device, or system) in a system. These attributes can include a username, email address, roles, and more. In the context of a system, an identity is used to determine the actions that an entity is allowed to perform.
    - Secrets are sensitive data that are used to authenticate or authorize identities. Examples of secrets include passwords, API keys, tokens, and private keys. Secrets need to be protected because if they are exposed, they can lead to unauthorized access or a security breach.

2. Identity and Secrets Management:
    - Identity and secrets management involves securely handling and storing identities and secrets. This includes creating and managing identities, assigning and managing permissions, and securely storing and managing secrets.
    - In the context of a system, this often involves using a secure storage solution for secrets, such as a secrets manager or a vault. These solutions encrypt secrets and control access to them.
    - Identity management often involves using an Identity Provider (IdP) that handles identity creation, authentication, authorization, and other identity-related tasks. This can include systems like Active Directory, OAuth, or OpenID Connect.
    - It's also important to implement principles like least privilege (only granting the minimum permissions necessary for a task) and rotation of secrets (regularly changing secrets to reduce the risk of them being compromised).
# Questions
1. What is identity and what is secret?
2. How do you store identities and secrets in an application? Why is't not safe to hardcode them in the code?
3. How to prevent hard-coding identities and secrets in the code?
# Answers
1. An identity is a set of attributes that define an entity (user, device, or system) in a system. These attributes can include a username, email address, roles, and more. In the context of a system, an identity is used to determine the actions that an entity is allowed to perform. A secret, on the other hand, is a sensitive piece of data that is used to authenticate or authorize identities. Examples of secrets include passwords, API keys, tokens, and private keys. Secrets need to be protected because if they are exposed, they can lead to unauthorized access or a security breach.

2. Identities and secrets should be stored securely in an application. They should not be hardcoded in the code because if the code is exposed or leaked (for example, in a public version control system), the identities and secrets would be exposed as well, leading to a potential security breach. Instead, they should be stored in a secure and encrypted manner. For example, secrets can be stored in a secure vault or a secrets manager, and identities can be stored in a secure database.

3. To prevent hard-coding identities and secrets in the code, you can use environment variables, configuration files, or secure storage solutions. These methods allow you to separate the sensitive data from the code. For example, in a Spring Boot application, you can use the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file to store configuration properties, and you can use Spring's `@Value` annotation to inject the properties into your classes. For storing secrets, you can use secure storage solutions like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault.
