# Go Runtime/Scheduler

The Go runtime scheduler is a key component of GoLang's concurrency model. It manages the execution of goroutines, Go's
lightweight and independently executing functions.

**M:N Scheduling**

Go's scheduler implements M:N scheduling, where M goroutines are multiplexed onto N OS threads. This allows many more
goroutines than the number of available threads.

**Goroutines**

Goroutines are the basic unit of execution in Go. They are much lighter than OS threads, typically requiring less memory
and overhead to create and switch between.

**Non-blocking I/O**

The Go scheduler is integrated with [Go's network poller](#go-network-poller), allowing goroutines to block on I/O
without blocking the underlying thread, thereby freeing it to run other goroutines.

**Cooperative Scheduling**

Goroutines are cooperatively scheduled. This means that a goroutine keeps running until it voluntarily yields control,
usually by performing a blocking operation like I/O, synchronization, or calling `runtime.Gosched()`.

## Go Network Poller

Go's network poller is an internal feature of the Go runtime that efficiently manages network I/O operations, allowing
goroutines to block on network I/O without blocking the entire operating system thread. This is a key part of Go's
concurrency model and its ability to handle a large number of concurrent network connections efficiently.

### Overview

1. **Non-Blocking I/O**: Go's network poller uses non-blocking I/O operations under the hood. When a goroutine performs
   a network I/O operation (like reading from a TCP connection), it doesn't block the entire thread. Instead, if the I/O
   operation cannot be completed immediately (for instance, if no data is available for a read operation), the goroutine
   is paused, and the thread is freed up to run other goroutines.

2. **OS Integration**: The network poller integrates closely with the operating system's event notification mechanisms (
   like epoll on Linux, kqueue on BSD, and IOCP on Windows). These mechanisms notify the poller when I/O operations on
   file descriptors (like sockets) are ready to proceed.

3. **Goroutine Resumption**: When the network poller receives a notification that an I/O operation can proceed, it
   schedules the corresponding goroutine for execution. The goroutine then resumes as if it had been blocked, but
   without having tied up an OS thread while waiting.

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: This model is much more efficient than having one OS thread per connection, which is a traditional
  model in many other languages and frameworks. It allows Go programs to scale to handle tens of thousands of concurrent
  connections with minimal overhead.

- **Simplicity**: From a programmer's perspective, network I/O in Go still looks like synchronous, blocking operations.
  This makes it much easier to write and understand than explicitly asynchronous I/O code, as seen in other languages.

### Example Usage

When writing Go code that performs network operations, you don't need to do anything special to take advantage of the
network poller. It's automatically used by standard library functions like `net.Dial`, `net.Listen`, and methods
on `net.Conn` objects.

```go
conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", "example.com:80")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer conn.Close()

// Use conn for network I/O; the network poller automatically manages the I/O operations
```

### Limitations

- **File I/O**: The network poller is optimized for network I/O and doesn't handle file I/O. File I/O in Go is blocking
  at the thread level.

- **Custom Schedulers**: Since the network poller is an internal part of the Go runtime, it's not something that can be
  easily replaced or customized.

The Go network poller is a great example of how Go's runtime and standard library work together to make concurrent
programming more efficient and easier for developers. It abstracts away the complexities of non-blocking I/O,
epoll/kqueue/IOCP, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their applications.

## How the Go Scheduler Works

The Go scheduler is a key component of Go's runtime system, enabling the language's powerful concurrency model. It's
responsible for distributing Go's goroutines over available CPU cores for execution. Unlike traditional operating system
schedulers, the Go scheduler is designed specifically to work with goroutines, which are much lighter than OS threads.

### Key Concepts

1. **Goroutines**: These are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, not the OS. They are much cheaper to create
   and destroy compared to OS threads.

2. **M (Machine)**: Represents an OS thread. M executes Go code and needs a P to execute Go code.

3. **P (Processor)**: A resource that holds a context for executing Go code. It's a logical construct that determines
   the number of OS threads that can execute user-level Go code simultaneously.

4. **G (Goroutine)**: A goroutine waiting to be executed.

### How the Scheduler Works

1. **M-P-G Relationship**: The scheduler maps `M`s to `P`s to execute `G`s. Each `P` can have multiple `G`s queued up
   for execution, and the scheduler assigns these `G`s to an `M` for execution. A single `M` can only execute one `G` at
   a time.

2. **Work Stealing**: When an `M` finishes executing a `G`, it needs a new `G` to execute. It first looks in its local
   run queue (attached to its `P`). If it finds a `G` there, it executes it. If not, it tries to steal a `G` from
   another `P`'s run queue.

3. **Syscall and I/O Handling**: When a `G` makes a syscall or gets blocked in I/O, its `M` is detached and can pick up
   another `G` to execute. This ensures that other `G`s can execute while one is waiting for I/O or syscalls. The `G`
   blocked in I/O or syscall is later picked up by a different `M`.

4. **Synchronization and Preemption**: To keep all CPUs utilized and to ensure that no single `G` hogs the CPU, the
   scheduler periodically checks and preempts long-running `G`s. This is done every few milliseconds (as of Go 1.14,
   it's done using asynchronous preemption).

5. **Netpoller Integration**: For network I/O, Go's netpoller can put `G`s to sleep without occupying an `M`, and wake
   them up when I/O is ready, at which point they get scheduled again.

### Scheduler Design Philosophy

- **Concurrency with Lightweight Goroutines**: By making goroutines cheap to create and manage, Go allows for easy
  concurrency.

- **Efficient with CPU and Memory**: By using a small number of OS threads and managing goroutines efficiently, Go
  programs can run with less memory and CPU overhead compared to traditional threading models.

- **Fairness and Responsiveness**: The work-stealing algorithm and preemption ensure that no goroutine is starved and
  that all get a chance to run.

- **Simplicity**: From a developer's standpoint, the scheduler's complexities are hidden. You write straightforward
  concurrent code with goroutines and channels, and the scheduler takes care of the rest.

### Example Usage

When you write Go code, you don't interact directly with the scheduler. You simply start goroutines:

```go
go func() {
    // some work
}()
```

The scheduler handles the execution of this goroutine alongside others, balancing them across available threads and
cores.

### Conclusion

Go's scheduler is a powerful abstraction layer that allows developers to write concurrent code without having to deal
with the complexities of thread management or CPU-bound scheduling. Its design promotes efficient and scalable
concurrency, making Go a strong choice for high-concurrency applications.

## Goroutine States

Goroutines in Go can be in several different states during their lifecycle. Understanding these states is crucial for
grasping how Go's concurrency model and scheduler work. Here are the primary states a goroutine can be in:

### 1. Runnable

In this state, the goroutine is ready to run but is not currently executing. Runnable goroutines are waiting in a queue
for a turn to be scheduled on an available thread (M).

A goroutine that has just been created is in the runnable state. It's also the state a goroutine re-enters after being
unblocked or when it yields the processor.

### 2. Executing

The goroutine is currently executing on a thread (M). Only one goroutine can execute on a single thread at any given
time.

This is the state when a goroutine's code is actively running.

### 3. Waiting (Blocked)

The goroutine is in a waiting state and not doing any work. This state occurs when the goroutine is blocked, waiting for
some event (like I/O operation completion, channel send/receive operation, waiting on mutex, etc.).

Common examples include waiting for data from a network connection, waiting for a timer, or waiting for another
goroutine to send data on a channel.

### 4. Sleeping

Similar to waiting, but it specifically refers to goroutines that are paused for a set amount of time.

A goroutine goes into a sleeping state when it calls `time.Sleep` or when a timer is set.

### 5. Dead

The goroutine has finished its execution and is no longer active.

This state is reached after a goroutine successfully completes its work and exits or if it exits prematurely due to an
unhandled error.

### 6. Suspended (or Preempted)

In newer versions of Go (especially since Go 1.14), a running goroutine can be preempted to prevent it from monopolizing
the thread. The scheduler might suspend a goroutine that has been running for too long to give other goroutines a chance
to run.

This state is part of Go's strategy to improve fairness and prevent long-running goroutines from causing starvation of
other goroutines.

### Understanding Goroutine States

- **Transitioning Between States**: Goroutines switch between these states during their lifecycle, managed by the Go
  scheduler.
- **Visibility to Developers**: These states are mostly abstracted away from the developer. You don't typically manage
  these states directly in your Go code; instead, you focus on the logic of goroutines and channels.
- **Debugging and Profiling**: Understanding these states is helpful during debugging and performance profiling, as they
  can provide insights into concurrency issues, bottlenecks, or performance problems in Go programs.

The Go scheduler efficiently manages these states, abstracting much of the complexity away from the programmer, allowing
focus on the concurrent logic of the application rather than on low-level threading and synchronization details.

## Goroutine Scheduling

Goroutine scheduling in Go is handled by the Go runtime scheduler, which is a part of the Go runtime. This scheduler is
different from traditional thread schedulers found in operating systems. Its main purpose is to distribute Goroutines -
the lightweight, user-space threads in Go - across available OS threads in an efficient manner.

### Key Principles of Goroutine Scheduling

1. **M:N Scheduling**: The Go runtime implements M:N scheduling, which multiplexes `M` goroutines onto `N` OS threads.
   This allows efficient use of system resources, as goroutines are much lighter than threads, both in terms of memory
   overhead and context switching costs.

2. **Goroutines (G)**: These are the entities that run Go code. They are lightweight and cheap to create and destroy.

3. **Machine (M)**: Represents an actual OS thread. M executes Go code or Go's runtime code.

4. **Processor (P)**: A resource that represents the capability to execute Go code. It holds the context required for
   executing goroutines and has a local run queue of goroutines.

### Scheduling Process

1. **Assignment of P to M**: When an OS thread (M) is initialized, it acquires a P. The P maintains a local run queue of
   goroutines that are ready to be executed.

2. **Executing Goroutines**: M takes a goroutine (G) from the run queue of its P and executes it.

3. **Syscall and Blocking Calls**: If a goroutine makes a blocking syscall or gets blocked in some other way (like
   channel operations), the P is detached from M, and M is either parked or gets a new P to continue executing other
   goroutines. This ensures that system calls or blocking operations don’t stall the execution of other goroutines.

4. **Work Stealing**: If an M finds its local run queue empty, it tries to steal goroutines from other P's run queue.

5. **Preemption**: Since Go 1.14, goroutines are preemptible. This means that a goroutine that's running for too long
   can be stopped in the middle of its execution to allow other goroutines to run. This prevents a single goroutine from
   monopolizing the CPU.

6. **Network Poller**: The Go scheduler integrates with a network poller to efficiently handle I/O operations.
   Goroutines waiting for I/O are parked in such a way that they don’t consume any CPU resources.

### Scheduling in Practice

- When writing Go code, you don't interact directly with the scheduler. You simply start goroutines using the `go`
  keyword.
- The scheduler handles the complexity of managing goroutines, allowing you to focus on the application logic.

### Considerations

- **Concurrency vs. Parallelism**: While the scheduler enables concurrency (multiple goroutines executing in an
  interleaved manner), parallel execution depends on having multiple threads (M) running on multiple CPU cores.
- **Tuning**: You can control the number of system threads that execute user-level Go code by setting the `GOMAXPROCS`
  variable. By default, it's set to the number of CPU cores available.

### Conclusion

Go's scheduler is an efficient and sophisticated tool that abstracts the complexities of concurrency and parallelism. It
allows developers to write highly concurrent programs without delving into the intricacies of thread management and
synchronization.

## Goroutine Yielding

In Go, goroutines are cooperatively scheduled, meaning that a goroutine continues to run until it voluntarily yields
control. This yielding of control can happen implicitly or explicitly. Unlike preemptive threading models where the
operating system decides when a thread should yield, in Go, the goroutine has more control over its own scheduling.

### Implicit Yielding

Goroutines yield control to the scheduler implicitly in several scenarios:

1. **Blocking on I/O**: When a goroutine performs I/O operations such as reading from a file or a network connection, it
   yields as these operations are blocking. The Go runtime scheduler then schedules another goroutine to run.

2. **Blocking on Channels**: When a goroutine tries to send/receive on a channel and if the operation cannot proceed
   immediately (e.g., sending on a full channel or receiving from an empty one), the goroutine yields.

3. **Blocking on Synchronization Primitives**: If a goroutine is blocked waiting on synchronization primitives like
   mutexes (`sync.Mutex`) or waiting groups (`sync.WaitGroup`), it yields.

4. **System Calls and Sleeping**: Goroutines yield when making certain system calls or when calling `time.Sleep`.

5. **Garbage Collection**: Goroutines may yield during garbage collection cycles.

### Explicit Yielding

Explicit yielding can be achieved using:

1. **`runtime.Gosched()`:** This function is a way to yield the processor, allowing other goroutines to run. It doesn't
   suspend the current goroutine, which continues execution almost immediately, but it does allow other goroutines on
   the same thread to proceed.

    ```go
    go func() {
        for {
            doWork()
            runtime.Gosched() // Yield the processor
        }
    }()
    ```

   Using `runtime.Gosched()` is generally not necessary and should be used judiciously. It's useful in cases where a
   goroutine might otherwise block other goroutines from running due to tight loops or heavy computation.

2. **`select` with `default`**: In a `select` statement without any blocking cases, the `default` case can be used to
   yield.

    ```go
    select {
    case <-someChan:
        // perform operation
    default:
        // Yield
    }
    ```

### Preemption

Since Go 1.14, the scheduler has the ability to preempt long-running goroutines at certain safe points, effectively
introducing a form of cooperative multitasking with a safety net to prevent any single goroutine from monopolizing the
CPU.

### Best Practices

- **Avoid Tight Loops**: In a tight loop, a goroutine may not yield control, leading to issues like starvation of other
  goroutines. It's good practice to avoid such constructs or use explicit yielding if necessary.

- **Rely on Implicit Yielding**: In most cases, Go's runtime handles yielding efficiently, and explicit intervention is
  not needed.

- **Understand Runtime Behavior**: Knowing how and when goroutines yield is crucial for writing efficient concurrent Go
  programs, especially in applications where performance and resource utilization are critical.

In summary, while Go provides mechanisms for explicit yielding, its runtime is designed to manage goroutine scheduling
efficiently without much need for direct intervention from the programmer.

## Goroutine Preemption

Goroutine preemption in Go is a mechanism by which the Go runtime scheduler can interrupt the execution of a goroutine
and switch to running another goroutine. This feature is crucial for ensuring that long-running or compute-intensive
goroutines do not monopolize the CPU, thereby allowing other goroutines to run in a timely manner.

### Evolution of Preemption in Go

- **Before Go 1.14**: Prior to version 1.14, goroutine preemption in Go was somewhat cooperative. A goroutine would
  yield to the scheduler only at specific points, such as when performing a blocking operation (like I/O, channel
  operations, or acquiring a mutex). This meant that if a goroutine entered a long-running computation without such
  operations, it could potentially run for an extended period without yielding, leading to latency issues in other
  goroutines.

- **Go 1.14 and Later**: Starting with Go 1.14, the scheduler introduced asynchronous preemption. This means goroutines
  can be preempted at almost any point in their execution, not just at well-defined points like I/O operations or
  channel sends/receives. This was a significant improvement in the Go scheduler, enhancing the responsiveness and
  fairness of the scheduling system.

### How Preemption Works in Go 1.14+

1. **Safe-Point Preemption**: Preemption occurs at "safe points," which are points in the code where the runtime has
   precise information about the goroutine's state. This typically happens when a function call occurs.

2. **Implementation via Asynchronous Signals**: The Go runtime periodically sends asynchronous signals to the thread (M)
   executing a goroutine. When the thread receives this signal, if the current goroutine is at a safe point, it gets
   preempted, and the scheduler can choose another goroutine to run.

3. **Impact on Long-Running Computations**: With the introduction of asynchronous preemption, long-running computations
   or tight loops no longer block the scheduler indefinitely. They can be preempted, improving the ability of other
   goroutines to get CPU time.

### Implications of Preemption

- **Improved Fairness**: The scheduler can more fairly distribute CPU time across goroutines, improving the
  responsiveness of Go applications.

- **Reduced Latency for Goroutines**: Applications with goroutines that perform long computations will experience
  reduced latency in other goroutines waiting to run.

- **No Changes in Goroutine Coding Practices**: For Go developers, this change in the scheduler is transparent. The way
  goroutines are coded remains the same, as preemption is handled entirely by the runtime.

### Considerations

- **Not Real-Time**: While preemption improves the scheduling fairness, Go is still not suitable for hard real-time
  systems due to the non-deterministic nature of the scheduler and garbage collector.

- **Safe Points and Function Calls**: The reliance on safe points means that extremely tight loops with no function
  calls might still lead to delayed preemption.

In summary, goroutine preemption in Go, especially since version 1.14, provides a more responsive and fair scheduling
system, enhancing the concurrency model of the language without requiring changes in the way developers write
goroutines.

## Goroutine Stacks

Goroutines in Go are famous for their lightweight nature, partly due to how their stacks are managed. Unlike traditional
threads in many other programming languages, which often start with a large stack space (often in the order of
megabytes), goroutines begin with a much smaller stack size. This efficient management of stack space is key to allowing
Go programs to spawn thousands of goroutines simultaneously without consuming excessive amounts of memory.

### Initial Stack Size and Dynamic Growth

1. **Initial Size**: As of my last update, a goroutine in Go starts with a small stack, typically a few
   kilobytes in size (the exact size has evolved across Go versions. In Go 2.14 the size is 2048 bytes).

2. **Dynamic Growth**: The stack can grow (and shrink) dynamically at runtime as needed. When a goroutine's stack
   reaches its limit, the runtime allocates a new, larger stack and copies the existing stack's contents to the new
   stack. This process is often referred to as "stack copying" or "stack splitting."

3. **Segmented Stacks vs. Continuous Growth**: Earlier versions of Go used segmented stacks, but the current
   implementation favors a continuous stack that grows dynamically. This approach simplifies the runtime and reduces the
   overhead of managing multiple stack segments.

### How Stack Growth is Triggered

- Stack growth is typically triggered by function calls. When a function is called, the runtime checks whether there is
  enough space on the stack for the function's local variables and for the function call itself. If there isn't enough
  space, a larger stack is allocated, and the contents are moved.

- This check-and-grow mechanism ensures that the stack grows only when necessary, making goroutines memory-efficient.

### Advantages of Goroutine Stacks

1. **Memory Efficiency**: The small initial size and dynamic growth of goroutine stacks mean that Go programs can manage
   a large number of goroutines with a relatively small memory footprint.

2. **Scalability**: Because of their lightweight nature, goroutines enable highly scalable concurrent programming. You
   can have thousands, or even tens of thousands, of goroutines running concurrently without overwhelming system
   resources.

3. **Simplicity**: From the programmer's perspective, this behavior is transparent. You don't need to manage stack sizes
   or growth, as the runtime handles this automatically.

### Challenges and Considerations

- **Stack Overflows**: While rare, stack overflows can still occur if a goroutine's stack grows beyond a certain limit.
  The Go runtime sets a maximum stack size (which has evolved across versions, but is significantly larger than the
  initial stack size) to prevent excessive stack growth. Max size for 64-bit is **1Gb** and for 32-bit **256Mb**.

- **Performance Overhead**: While typically minimal, the process of growing the stack has a performance cost. This is
  usually negligible but can be more noticeable in deeply recursive functions or in scenarios with tight loops calling
  many functions.

- **Debugging**: Understanding stack traces in Go can be more complex due to stack growth, especially when dealing with
  panics or stack-related errors.

- **Limitations in C-Go Interoperability**: When calling C functions using cgo, stack management becomes more complex
  since C functions don't have the same stack growth mechanism as Go functions. This requires careful consideration to
  avoid stack overflows when using large amounts of stack space in C functions.

### Best Practices

1. **Avoid Deep Recursion**: Prefer iterative solutions over deep recursion where possible, as recursion can lead to
   rapid stack growth.

2. **Mindful Use of Goroutines**: While it's tempting to use goroutines liberally due to their lightweight nature, it's
   still important to use them judiciously, especially in applications where memory usage is a concern.

3. **Understand Runtime Behavior**: Being aware of how the Go runtime manages goroutine stacks can help in optimizing
   performance and diagnosing issues related to memory usage.

In summary, Go's handling of goroutine stacks is a cornerstone of its concurrency model, enabling efficient, scalable,
and concurrent applications. This system is largely transparent to the developer, but an understanding of its workings
can be beneficial in optimizing and debugging Go programs.

## Goroutine Scheduling Events

Goroutine scheduling in Go is governed by specific events that can cause a goroutine to be scheduled, descheduled, or
rescheduled. These events are integral to understanding how concurrency works in Go and how goroutines interact with the
Go scheduler. Here's an overview of key scheduling events:

### 1. Goroutine Creation

- **Event**: When a new goroutine is created using the `go` keyword.
- **Action**: The new goroutine is placed in the local run queue of the current `P` (processor).
- **Effect**: If there's an available `M` (machine, i.e., thread), it will pick up the goroutine for execution.

### 2. System Calls

- **Event**: When a goroutine makes a system call that could block (e.g., file or network operations).
- **Action**: The `M` executing the goroutine is blocked, but the `P` is detached and can be assigned to another `M`.
- **Effect**: This prevents the blocking system call from halting other goroutines' execution.

### 3. Channel Operations

- **Event**: Operations on channels (send/receive) where the other side of the channel is not ready.
- **Action**: The goroutine is descheduled and placed in the wait queue of the channel.
- **Effect**: It remains in the wait queue until the channel operation can proceed.

### 4. Mutex Locking

- **Event**: When a goroutine attempts to acquire a mutex (`sync.Mutex`) that is already locked.
- **Action**: The goroutine is descheduled and enters a waiting state.
- **Effect**: It will be rescheduled once the mutex becomes available.

### 5. Sleeping

- **Event**: Calls to `time.Sleep` or similar time-based blocking operations.
- **Action**: The goroutine is descheduled and enters a timer-based waiting queue.
- **Effect**: It will be rescheduled when the timer expires.

### 6. Goroutine Termination

- **Event**: When a goroutine finishes its execution.
- **Action**: The goroutine is removed from the execution context.
- **Effect**: Resources used by the goroutine are freed.

### 7. Preemption

- **Event**: As of Go 1.14, goroutines can be preempted to prevent them from monopolizing the CPU.
- **Action**: The scheduler may preempt a long-running goroutine at a safe point.
- **Effect**: This allows other goroutines to get CPU time, improving responsiveness and fairness.

### 8. Network Poller Integration

- **Event**: In case of network I/O operations, the network poller plays a role.
- **Action**: Goroutines waiting for network I/O are parked in the network poller.
- **Effect**: They are rescheduled when I/O is ready, without blocking an `M`.

### 9. Garbage Collection

- **Event**: During garbage collection cycles.
- **Action**: Goroutines may be paused temporarily.
- **Effect**: This is to ensure that garbage collection can proceed safely.

### Understanding Scheduling Events

- **Fair Scheduling**: The Go scheduler aims to fairly distribute CPU time among goroutines, and these scheduling events
  ensure that no single goroutine can block the progress of others.
- **Efficiency**: By descheduling goroutines during blocking operations and efficiently managing CPU-bound operations,
  the Go scheduler allows for high concurrency with minimal overhead.
- **Developer Transparency**: For the most part, these scheduling details are abstracted away from the developer,
  providing a simple and powerful concurrency model.

Being aware of these events can be especially useful when debugging concurrency issues or optimizing performance in Go
applications.

### Goroutine Scheduling in Practice

Goroutine scheduling in Go, in actual practice, involves a few key concepts that enable efficient execution of
concurrent operations. Here's a closer look at how it works and the implications for Go developers:

#### Efficient Concurrency

1. **Lightweight Goroutines**: Goroutines are lightweight and have small initial stack sizes. This design allows you to
   create thousands of goroutines without consuming large amounts of system memory.

2. **M:N Scheduling**: The Go runtime schedules M goroutines onto N OS threads (where typically, N is less than or equal
   to the number of cores). This multiplexing is done by the runtime and is transparent to the developer.

3. **Non-Blocking by Design**: Go encourages writing non-blocking code, particularly with its built-in features like
   channels and select statements. This approach avoids blocking an entire thread, allowing other goroutines to execute.

#### Real-World Scenarios

1. **I/O Bound Operations**: During network or disk I/O, which are common blocking operations, the Go runtime
   automatically suspends the involved goroutine and resumes it when the I/O operation is complete. This ensures that
   the thread is free to execute other goroutines.

2. **CPU Bound Operations**: For CPU-intensive tasks, Go’s runtime preempts long-running goroutines at certain safe
   points to ensure other goroutines get CPU time. This is especially useful to prevent one goroutine from monopolizing
   the CPU.

#### Best Practices and Considerations

1. **Concurrency vs Parallelism**: Go makes it easy to write concurrent programs, but parallel execution depends on the
   runtime and the environment. It’s important to design your program with this distinction in mind.

2. **Proper Synchronization**: Even though Go handles low-level scheduling, you still need to synchronize shared data
   access using mutexes, channels, or other synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions.

3. **Resource Utilization**: While goroutines are cheap, they aren't free. It's important to understand the resource
   implications of spawning a large number of goroutines and to use patterns like worker pools to manage resource usage.

4. **Error Handling**: In concurrent Go programs, managing and propagating errors properly is crucial. Channels are
   often used for this purpose, allowing errors to be returned from goroutines to the main execution flow.

5. **Debugging and Profiling**: Tools like the Go runtime tracer (`runtime/trace`) and pprof can be very helpful in
   understanding how goroutines behave in your application, particularly in identifying bottlenecks or deadlock
   situations.

#### Conclusion

Goroutine scheduling in Go is a powerful feature that allows developers to write highly concurrent applications in an
efficient and relatively simple manner. By understanding and leveraging the Go runtime's capabilities, you can create
robust, scalable, and maintainable concurrent applications.

## Best Practices

- **Leverage Goroutines for Concurrency**: The scheduler is designed to efficiently manage thousands of goroutines.
  Utilize them for concurrent tasks.
- **Avoid Long-Running Goroutines**: Since Go uses cooperative scheduling, long-running goroutines can potentially block
  the execution of other goroutines.
- **Be Mindful of Blocking Operations**: Blocking operations in a goroutine can impact the performance and
  responsiveness of your application.
- **Use Default GOMAXPROCS**: The Go runtime sets `GOMAXPROCS` (maximum number of OS threads that can execute user-level
  Go code simultaneously) intelligently by default. Only change it if there's a good reason.

## Example: Demonstrating Goroutine Scheduling

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "runtime"
    "time"
)

func printNumbers() {
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
        fmt.Printf("%d ", i)
    }
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("GOMAXPROCS:", runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0)) // Print the number of OS threads

    go printNumbers()
    go printNumbers()

    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    fmt.Println("\nFinished")
}
```

In this example, two goroutines are running concurrently. The Go scheduler efficiently manages their execution on the
available OS threads.

## Conclusion

The Go runtime scheduler is a powerful feature that enables the efficient and easy handling of concurrency in Go
applications. Its design allows for massive concurrency with minimal overhead, making Go an ideal language for
high-concurrency tasks. Understanding how the Go scheduler works and its interaction with goroutines and OS threads is
key to writing efficient Go applications, especially those that require high levels of concurrency.
