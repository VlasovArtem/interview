## Relational Database ACID Properties: Isolation

Isolation is one of the ACID properties in relational databases that ensures individual transactions are executed in a
way that they are isolated from one another. This means the operations of one transaction are not visible to other
concurrent transactions until they are committed.

- **[Concurrent Transactions](#concurrent-transactions)**: Manages how changes made in one transaction are not visible
  to other concurrent transactions until the changes are committed.
- **[Isolation Levels](isolation-levels.md#isolation-levels)**: Databases implement different isolation levels
    - [Read Uncommitted](isolation-levels.md#read-uncommitted)
    - [Read Committed](isolation-levels.md#read-committed)
    - [Repeatable Read](isolation-levels.md#repeatable-read),
    - [Serializable](isolation-levels.md#serializable)
      each providing a different balance between concurrency and consistency.
- **[Locking Mechanisms](locks.md)**: Uses locks (shared and exclusive) to control access to data during transactions.
- **[Phantom Reads](isolation-levels.md#phantom-reads)
  and [Non-repeatable Reads](isolation-levels.md#non-repeatable-reads)**: Isolation levels manage common issues in
  concurrent transactions, like non-repeatable reads and phantom reads, to maintain data accuracy.

## Concurrent Transactions

Isolation, a key ACID property in relational databases, refers to the ability of the database to execute multiple
transactions concurrently without them interfering with each other. This ensures the integrity of the database by
isolating the impact of individual transactions.

- **Isolation Levels**: Databases provide different levels of isolation (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed,
  Repeatable Read, Serializable) to control how transaction changes are visible to other transactions.
- **Locking Mechanisms**: Employ shared and exclusive locks to manage access to data. Shared locks allow other
  transactions to read but not write the locked data, while exclusive locks prevent other transactions from reading
  or writing.
- **Handling Data Anomalies**: Different levels of isolation are used to prevent common data anomalies in concurrent
  transactions, such as dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

### Q&A

#### How do different isolation levels balance data integrity and performance in concurrent transactions?

Different isolation levels balance data integrity and performance by providing varying degrees of 'separation' between
concurrent transactions. Lower isolation levels like 'Read Uncommitted' allow transactions to see uncommitted changes
made by other transactions, which can lead to data anomalies but offer higher performance due to fewer locks and less
waiting. Higher isolation levels like 'Serializable' provide complete isolation, ensuring data integrity by preventing
all concurrent transaction anomalies. However, this can lead to decreased performance due to increased locking and
reduced concurrency. Intermediate levels like 'Read Committed' and 'Repeatable Read' provide a balance, allowing some
degree of concurrency while avoiding most anomalies. The choice of isolation level in a database depends on the specific
requirements and workload characteristics, where the goal is to achieve the necessary data integrity without overly
compromising on performance.

### Q&A

#### How do different isolation levels in a relational database affect transaction processing and data integrity?

Different isolation levels in a relational database affect transaction processing and data integrity by balancing the
trade-off between concurrency and consistency. Lower isolation levels like 'Read Uncommitted' allow higher concurrency
but can lead to issues like dirty reads, where a transaction reads uncommitted changes from another transaction. Higher
isolation levels like 'Serializable' ensure complete isolation of transactions, thus maintaining data integrity, but at
the cost of reduced concurrency due to stricter locking mechanisms. Intermediate levels like 'Read Committed' and '
Repeatable Read' offer a balance, allowing some concurrency while preventing most of the common consistency issues. The
choice of isolation level depends on the specific requirements of the application, particularly how it prioritizes
consistency versus performance.
