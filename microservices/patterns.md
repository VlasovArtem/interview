Microservices architecture is a method of developing software systems that structures an application as a collection of
loosely coupled services. This architectural style has gained widespread popularity due to its scalability, flexibility,
and ability to enable rapid, frequent, and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. Here are some common
patterns associated with microservices:

# 1. **Decomposition Patterns**

- **Decompose by Business Capability:** Services are organized around business capabilities like user management,
  billing, etc.
- **Decompose by Subdomain:** Follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach, decomposing systems by subdomain.

# 2. **Integration Patterns**

- **API Gateway Pattern:** A single entry point for all clients, routing requests to appropriate microservices.
- **Backend For Frontend (BFF):** Customized backends for different types of clients, like mobile, web, etc.
- **Service Mesh:** A dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication.

# 3. **Database Patterns**

- **Database per Service:** Each microservice has its own database, ensuring loose coupling.
- **Shared Database:** Multiple services share the same database, which can simplify data management but reduces
  independence.
- **SAGA Pattern:** A way to manage data consistency across services in distributed transactions.

# 4. **Observability Patterns**

- **Log Aggregation:** Consolidating logs from all services into a central tool for analysis.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Tracking requests across various microservices for performance monitoring.
- **Health Check API:** Implementing APIs to report the health and performance of microservices.

# 5. **Deployment Patterns**

- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Reduces downtime and risk by running two identical environments.
- **Canary Releases:** Gradually rolling out changes to a small subset of users before a full rollout.
- **Containerization:** Using Docker or similar technologies for deploying microservices.

# 6. **Cross-cutting Concerns Patterns**

- **Externalized Configuration:** Managing application configuration outside the service.
- **Service Discovery:** Mechanisms for services to find and communicate with each other.
- **Circuit Breaker:** Handling failures gracefully and preventing system failure due to cascading issues.

# 7. **Security Patterns**

- **Access Token:** Using tokens for securing service-to-service communication.
- **Identity Propagation:** Ensuring the user's identity is passed across service boundaries for access control.

# 8. **Communication Patterns**

- **Synchronous Communication (REST, gRPC):** Services communicate using synchronous protocols like REST, HTTP, gRPC.
- **Asynchronous Communication (Event-driven):** Services communicate using asynchronous messaging or event-driven
  architectures.

# 9. **Design Patterns**

- **Strangler Pattern:** Gradually replacing parts of a monolithic application with microservices.
- **Anti-corruption Layer:** A way to prevent a legacy system from corrupting the design of new services.
- **Sidecar Pattern:** Deploying helper services alongside your application service, often used in service meshes.

# 10. **Testing Patterns**

- **Service Virtualization:** Simulating service behavior for testing purposes.
- **Consumer-Driven Contract:** A pattern where service providers use contracts defined by service consumers.

In practice, these patterns can be combined in numerous ways to address the specific needs of a software project. The
choice of patterns depends on various factors like the team's experience, system requirements, and the existing IT
environment.
