# Decompose by Business Capability

Decomposing by business capability is a fundamental principle in microservices architecture. This approach involves
structuring a system as a set of loosely coupled services, where each service is aligned with a specific business
capability. Let's dive into more detail about this concept.

## What is a Business Capability?

- **Definition:** A business capability is a high-level description of what a business does to create value. It's more
  about the "what" (functionality, service, or task the business performs) rather than the "how" (the specific
  technology or method used).
- **Examples:** In a retail business, distinct capabilities might include inventory management, order processing,
  customer relationship management, and billing.

## Principles of Decomposing by Business Capability

1. **Identify Business Capabilities:** The first step is to identify the core capabilities of your business. This
   usually involves collaboration with business stakeholders and might use techniques from domain-driven design (DDD).

2. **Align Services with Capabilities:** Each microservice is designed to handle a specific business capability. For
   example, in an e-commerce application, one service might handle inventory management while another deals with
   customer accounts.

3. **Autonomy:** Services are developed, deployed, and operated independently. This ensures that changes in one
   service (like updating a business process or policy) don't impact others.

4. **Focus on Business Goals:** Services are designed to achieve specific business outcomes, improving agility and
   responsiveness to changes in the business environment.

5. **Cross-functional Teams:** Teams are often structured around business capabilities, with the skills and resources to
   build and operate each service autonomously.

## Advantages

- **Improved Scalability:** Each service can be scaled independently based on demand for the specific business
  capability it supports.
- **Agility and Speed:** Teams can develop, test, and deploy their services independently, speeding up delivery and
  enabling faster response to business changes.
- **Resilience:** Failures in one service have limited impact on other services.
- **Clearer Understanding:** Aligning services with business capabilities makes it easier for new team members to
  understand the structure of the system.

## Challenges

- **Identifying Boundaries:** Determining the boundaries of each business capability can be complex and may require deep
  understanding of the business.
- **Inter-service Communication:** Services need to communicate with each other, which introduces complexity in terms of
  API management, data consistency, and network latency.
- **Overhead:** Each service may need its own database, transaction management, and other infrastructure, which can
  increase complexity and resource requirements.

## Best Practices

- **Start with a Domain Model:** Use domain-driven design to create a model of the business and identify boundaries.
- **Avoid Too Many Dependencies:** Services should be as independent as possible to avoid tight coupling.
- **Iterative Approach:** Start with a broader service scope and split services further as you gain more understanding.
- **Monitor and Adapt:** Continuously monitor the performance and relevance of your services, and be prepared to
  reorganize as business needs evolve.

In summary, decomposing by business capability is about aligning services with the high-level functions or capabilities
of a business. This approach helps create a system that is flexible, scalable, and easier to understand, but it requires
a deep understanding of the business and careful management of service boundaries and interactions.
