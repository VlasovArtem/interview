# Kafka Connect

Apache Kafka Connect is a tool for scalable and reliably streaming data between Apache Kafka and other systems. It is
designed to make it simple to quickly define connectors that move large collections of data into and out of Kafka. Kafka
Connect can be run as a standalone process or in a distributed mode. Here are the technical details of Kafka Connect:

- **Purpose**: To import data from external systems into Kafka topics and export data from Kafka topics to external
  systems.
- **Connectors**: The key component in Kafka Connect. Connectors define where, how, and what data should be copied to
  and from Kafka.

## Components of Kafka Connect

1. **Connector**: The high-level abstraction that coordinates data streaming by managing tasks.
2. **Task**: Responsible for actually copying data. A single connector may manage multiple tasks, distributing the data
   copying load.
3. **Worker**: The runtime context in which connectors and tasks are executed. Workers can be run in standalone or
   distributed mode.

## Connector Types

- **Source Connectors**: Import data from an external system into Kafka. For example, a database source connector could
  capture all changes in a database.
- **Sink Connectors**: Export data from Kafka topics to external systems. For example, a sink connector could write
  Kafka topic data to a file system or database.

## Kafka Connect Modes

1. **Standalone Mode**: Single process, suitable for development and testing environments. It is simple but does not
   offer the high availability and scalability of distributed mode.
2. **Distributed Mode**: Multiple worker processes coordinated to provide scalability and fault tolerance. This is the
   mode used in production environments.

## Configuration and Management

- **Configuration**: Connectors and tasks are configured through simple, declarative JSON or properties files. This
  configuration specifies the details of the external system and how data should be mapped to or from Kafka.
- **REST API**: Kafka Connect provides a REST API for managing connectors and tasks. This API can be used to add,
  remove, or monitor the status of connectors.

## Scalability and Fault Tolerance

- **Load Balancing**: In distributed mode, tasks are balanced across available workers.
- **Automatic Recovery**: If a worker or task fails, the system automatically redistributes the tasks to other workers.

## Data Transformation and Conversion

- **Single Message Transforms (SMTs)**: Kafka Connect supports simple transformations of data as it passes through
  Connect.
- **Schema Management**: Connect supports dynamic handling of message schemas, including schema evolution.

## Integration with Kafka Ecosystem

- **Compatibility**: Kafka Connect is designed to work well with Kafka's ecosystem, including Kafka Streams and Kafka
  security features.
- **Community Connectors**: There is a large library of community-contributed connectors for various data sources and
  sinks.

## Use Cases

- **Data Integration**: Integrating Kafka with data systems like databases, key-value stores, search indexes, and file
  systems.
- **Data Pipeline**: Building real-time data pipelines that reliably move data between systems.

Kafka Connect simplifies the integration of Kafka with other data systems. Its scalable and fault-tolerant architecture,
combined with a large ecosystem of connectors, makes it a powerful tool for data engineers looking to streamline their
data pipelines.
