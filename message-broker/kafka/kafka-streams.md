# Kafka Streams

Apache Kafka Streams is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data
are stored in Kafka clusters. It is designed to process and analyze data stored in Kafka and build real-time
applications and microservices that transform or react to the stream of records.

## Basic Concepts of Kafka Streams

- **Stream Processing Library**: Kafka Streams is not a separate service or system but a Java library for stream
  processing.
- **Data Flow**: Allows applications to process data from one or more Kafka topics, perform computations, and output the
  results back to Kafka topics.

## Key Features

1. **[Stateful](#stateful-processing-in-kafka-streams) and [Stateless](#stateless-processing-in-kafka-streams)
   Processing**: Supports both stateless and stateful operations, including windowed computations, joins, and
   aggregations.
2. **[Exactly-Once Processing Semantics](#exactly-once-semantics-in-kafka-streams)**: Ensures accurate computations,
   eliminating duplicates even in case of
   failures.
3. **[Stream-Table Duality](#stream-table-duality)**: Kafka Streams treats streams as tables and vice versa, providing
   flexibility in
   handling
   data.
4. **[Fault Tolerance](#fault-tolerance)**: Maintains state and supports fault-tolerant processing by integrating with
   Kafka's replication mechanism.

Apache Kafka Streams is a client library for stream processing in Kafka, providing powerful capabilities for both
stateful and stateless processing.

### Stateless Processing in Kafka Streams

Stateless processing involves operations where each record can be processed independently, without the need for context
or state information from previous records.

#### Key Features

- **Transformations**: Includes operations like `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, etc., which transform individual records.
- **No State Maintenance**: No need to keep track of previous records or state.
- **Scalability**: Easily scalable as each record is processed independently.

#### Use Cases

- **Simple Data Transformations**: Like converting data formats, filtering records based on a condition, or extracting
  and transforming fields from a message.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Where the processing of each message is independent, for instance, in logging or
  monitoring applications.

### Stateful Processing in Kafka Streams

Stateful processing, on the other hand, involves operations that depend on the state, which is derived from previous
records.

#### Key Features

- **State**: Maintains state derived from previous records. This state is managed and persists across application
  restarts.
- **Complex Operations**: Includes operations like `join`, `groupByKey`, `aggregate`, `windowed computations`, etc.
- **State Stores**: Kafka Streams uses state stores, either in-memory or persistent, to maintain state.

#### Use Cases

- **Aggregations**: Calculating aggregates like sum, average, or count over a period or amongst a group of messages.
- **Join Operations**: Joining streams or tables, for instance, enriching a stream of user actions with user profile
  information.
- **Windowed Computations**: Processing data in time-based windows, useful for time-series analysis.

#### Technical Aspects of Stateful Processing

- **Fault Tolerance**: Stateful operations in Kafka Streams are fault-tolerant. The state can be backed up to Kafka
  topics, enabling recovery in case of failures.
- **Interactive Queries**: Kafka Streams supports querying the state, allowing for serving the latest state directly
  from the application.
- **Timely Processing**: Kafka Streams supports windowing operations, allowing processing based on time windows (e.g.,
  tumbling, hopping, session windows).

#### Scalability and Performance

- **Partitioning**: Kafka Streams leverages Kafka topic partitions to distribute processing. Each task handles a subset
  of the partitions.
- **Load Balancing**: Kafka Streams applications can scale by adding more instances, which distribute the processing
  load.

#### Considerations

- **State Management Overhead**: Stateful processing requires managing and potentially replicating state, which can add
  complexity and overhead.
- **Resource Utilization**: Stateful operations, especially those involving large states or windowed operations, can be
  more resource-intensive.

Kafka Streams' ability to handle both stateful and stateless processing makes it a versatile tool for building complex
streaming applications. Stateless processing allows for simple, scalable processing of individual records, while
stateful processing enables sophisticated analysis and transformations based on aggregations or joins over time or
across different streams.

Apache Kafka Streams supports exactly-once processing semantics (EOS), ensuring that each record in a stream is
processed exactly once, even in the event of failures. This feature is crucial for applications where data accuracy and
consistency are paramount. Here's an in-depth look at exactly-once processing semantics in Kafka Streams:

### Exactly-Once Semantics in Kafka Streams

- **Goal**: To prevent data loss and duplication during processing, ensuring that each record is processed only once.
- **Context**: Especially relevant in a distributed system where failures and retries can lead to duplicate processing.

#### Implementation of Exactly-Once Semantics

1. **Idempotent Producers**: Kafka Streams uses idempotent producers, which ensure that messages are not duplicated in
   Kafka topics even if the producer retries sending them.
2. **Transactional Writes**: Kafka Streams writes records and commits offsets transactionally. It means that either both
   the record processing and offset commit are successful, or neither is.
3. **Consumer Offset Management**: Kafka Streams manages consumer offsets within the same transaction as the processed
   records, ensuring consistent state between the processing and the record offset tracking.

#### Technical Details

- **Producer and Consumer Configuration**: Producers and consumers within Kafka Streams applications are configured to
  enable exactly-once semantics by default when EOS is enabled.
- **State Management**: Kafka Streams maintains local state for stateful operations. The changes to local state and the
  output records are committed atomically to ensure exactly-once processing.
- **Processing Guarantees**: Even in case of application failures or rebalances, Kafka Streams ensures that there is no
  data duplication or loss, maintaining the EOS guarantees.

#### Benefits of Exactly-Once Semantics

- **Data Integrity**: Critical for applications where the accuracy of processing results is essential, such as financial
  transactions or data aggregation.
- **Elimination of Data Duplication**: Removes the need for deduplication logic in downstream systems.

#### Enabling Exactly-Once Semantics

- **Configuration**: To enable EOS in Kafka Streams, set the processing guarantee configuration to `exactly_once`. This
  can be done in the application's configuration settings.

#### Considerations and Trade-offs

- **Performance Overhead**: EOS can introduce additional processing overhead due to the management of transactions and
  idempotence. This can impact throughput and latency.
- **Broker Version**: EOS requires a minimum Kafka broker version (0.11.0 or later) as it relies on the broker's
  capabilities to handle transactions and idempotent operations.
- **Complexity**: Managing transactions adds complexity to the Kafka Streams application, especially in terms of error
  handling and state recovery.

Exactly-once processing semantics in Kafka Streams represents a significant advancement in stream processing, providing
robust guarantees that are crucial for many business-critical applications. By ensuring that each record is processed
exactly once, Kafka Streams helps prevent the typical pitfalls of distributed stream processing, such as data
duplication and inconsistencies.

### Stream-Table Duality

Apache Kafka Streams embraces the concept of stream-table duality, which is fundamental in understanding how Kafka
models data and processes streams. This concept is pivotal in Kafka Streams for building robust and dynamic streaming
applications. Here's an in-depth look at stream-table duality in Kafka Streams:

- **Duality Principle**: Stream-table duality is the idea that streams and tables are two sides of the same coin. A
  stream is a history of changes (events), while a table is a state at a specific point in time.
- **Stream as Change Log**: A stream can be thought of as a changelog of a table, where each data record in the stream
  captures a change in the table's state.
- **Table as Materialized View**: Conversely, a table can be considered a materialized view of a stream, representing
  the cumulative effect of the stream's records up to a certain point in time.

#### Streams in Kafka Streams

- **Definition**: A stream in Kafka Streams is a sequence of data records, where each record is a key-value pair.
- **Characteristic**: Streams are inherently ordered, immutable, and replayable, which means they can be processed to
  reconstruct a table's state.

#### Tables in Kafka Streams

- **Definition**: A table in Kafka Streams represents the latest value for each key in a stream. It is analogous to a
  relational database table but is dynamic and continuously updated.
- **Characteristic**: Tables provide a view of data at a particular point in time and can change as new records arrive
  in the associated stream.

#### Kafka Streams APIs for Duality

- **KStream**: Represents a record stream, where each data record in the stream is an independent entity.
- **KTable**: Represents a changelog stream, where each data record is an update (upsert) to the last value for a
  specific key.
- **GlobalKTable**: Similar to KTable, but provides a view of the data across all partitions.

#### Transformations and Operations

- **Stream to Table**: Converting a stream to a table involves aggregating records by keys, typically using operations
  like `groupByKey` followed by an aggregation like `count`, `reduce`, or `aggregate`.
- **Table to Stream**: Converting a table to a stream is straightforward as every change to a table can be represented
  as a record in a stream.

#### Use Cases and Applications

- **Join Operations**: Stream-table duality allows for sophisticated join operations between streams (KStream) and
  tables (KTable or GlobalKTable), enabling real-time data enrichment and complex event processing.
- **Stateful Stream Processing**: By converting a stream to a table, stateful operations like aggregations and joins can
  be performed.

#### Importance in Event Sourcing and CQRS

- **Event Sourcing**: The duality concept is key in event sourcing architectures where changes (events) are captured as
  a stream, and the current state is derived from these events.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Kafka Streams facilitates CQRS by allowing separate handling for
  command (stream processing) and query (table querying) sides.

Stream-table duality in Kafka Streams provides a powerful abstraction for dealing with real-time data. It allows
developers to seamlessly switch between viewing data as a stream of events (KStream) and as a current state (KTable),
broadening the possibilities for real-time data processing and analytics in distributed systems.

### Fault Tolerance

Apache Kafka's fault tolerance is a fundamental aspect of its design, enabling it to function reliably as a distributed
streaming platform. Kafka achieves high fault tolerance through various mechanisms, ensuring data availability and
consistency even in the presence of failures. Here's a detailed look at how Kafka maintains fault tolerance:

#### Replication

- **Partition Replicas**: Kafka replicates each partition across multiple brokers. This replication is the primary
  method for fault tolerance.
- **Leader and Followers**: Each partition has one leader and multiple follower replicas. The leader handles all read
  and write requests for the partition, while the followers replicate the leader’s data.
- **Automatic Leader Election**: In case of leader broker failure, one of the follower replicas is automatically elected
  as the new leader, ensuring continued data availability and accessibility.

#### In-Sync Replicas (ISR)

- **ISR Concept**: Kafka maintains a set of in-sync replicas for each partition. These replicas have fully replicated
  the leader's log.
- **Commit Requirement**: A message is considered committed when it has been written to the leader and replicated to a
  configurable number of in-sync replicas.
- **Fault Tolerance**: By requiring multiple replicas to acknowledge a message, Kafka ensures data durability and
  resilience against the loss of individual brokers.

#### Acknowledgment and Durability

- **Producer Acknowledgment Settings**: Producers can choose their level of acknowledgment (`acks`) to balance between
  performance and data reliability.
- **Durability**: Messages are written to disk on brokers, ensuring durability. Kafka's log compaction feature also
  contributes to durability by preserving data semantics over time.

#### Broker Failure and Recovery

- **Broker Failures**: Kafka is designed to handle broker failures gracefully. If a broker fails, partitions for which
  it was the leader are reassigned to other brokers.
- **Log Replication**: The log replication process ensures that the failed broker’s data is replicated to the new
  leader, minimizing data loss.

#### ZooKeeper Dependency

- **Cluster Metadata Management**: Kafka uses Apache ZooKeeper for managing cluster metadata, such as broker details,
  topic names, partitions, and replica information.
- **Leader Election and Coordination**: ZooKeeper is essential for leader election among brokers and coordinating some
  aspects of Kafka's distributed nature.

#### Network and Hardware Faults

- **Network Partitions**: Kafka is designed to handle network partitions, where communication between some parts of the
  cluster is lost.
- **Hardware Faults**: Kafka's distributed architecture allows it to continue operating even if individual servers or
  disks fail.

#### Consumer Fault Tolerance

- **Offset Management**: Consumers track their progress using offsets. Kafka stores these offsets so that consumers can
  resume from where they left off in case of failure.
- **Rebalancing**: Kafka consumers can automatically rebalance themselves in a consumer group if a consumer fails or a
  new one joins.

#### Monitoring and Alerting

- **Operational Monitoring**: Effective monitoring of Kafka clusters is essential for early detection of issues. Metrics
  like broker health, partition status, replication lag, and throughput are monitored.
- **Alerting Systems**: Integrating Kafka with alerting systems helps in quickly identifying and reacting to issues that
  could impact fault tolerance.

Kafka's fault tolerance features make it robust and resilient to a range of failure scenarios, from individual broker
failures to network partitions. This resilience is a key reason why Kafka is widely used for critical data pipelines and
streaming applications in distributed environments.

## Architecture

- **Topology**: A Kafka Streams application defines its computational logic through a topology, which is a graph of
  stream processors (nodes) and streams (edges).
- **Stream Processor**: A node in the topology that processes records, either transforming them, aggregating them, or
  splitting/merging streams.
- **Source and Sink Processors**: Special processors for reading from and writing to Kafka topics.

## Key APIs

1. **Streams DSL**: A high-level domain-specific language for writing stream processing applications. It provides common
   operations like `map`, `filter`, `join`, and `aggregate`.
2. **Processor API**: A lower-level API for defining and connecting processors and state stores directly.

## State Management

- **State Stores**: Kafka Streams provides state stores, which can be used to store and query data required for stateful
  operations.
- **Interactive Queries**: Allows querying the state stores directly from the application, enabling the building of
  stateful services.

## Scalability and Parallelism

- **Partitioning**: Kafka Streams leverages Kafka's topic partitions to parallelize processing. Each stream task
  processes data from one or more partitions.
- **Elasticity**: Supports adding or removing instances of the application for scaling up or down.

## Integration with Kafka Ecosystem

- **Consumer and Producer APIs**: Internally uses Kafka's consumer and producer APIs for reading and writing data.
- **Kafka Connect**: Can integrate with Kafka Connect for importing/exporting data from/to external systems.

## Deployment

- **Application Deployment**: Kafka Streams applications are standard Java applications and can be deployed like any
  other Java application, on bare-metal servers, virtual machines, containers, or cloud environments.

## Use Cases

- **Real-Time Analytics**: For applications that require real-time data processing and analytics.
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Building complex data pipelines that require transformations, aggregations, or joining
  different streams.

Kafka Streams is particularly useful for scenarios requiring real-time data processing and where low latency and
scalability are critical. It simplifies the development of complex data processing logic, directly leveraging the Kafka
infrastructure for high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.
