# Semantics Comparison

In Apache Kafka, there are three main types of message delivery semantics: at-most-once, at-least-once, and
exactly-once. Each offers a different balance between data reliability, performance, and complexity.

## 1. At-Most-Once Semantics

- **Data Reliability**: Low. Messages may be lost, but duplicates are not created.
- **Performance**: High. Low latency and high throughput, as there are no retries or waiting for acknowledgments.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for scenarios where speed is more critical than reliability, and message loss is acceptable (
  e.g., real-time monitoring where not every message is critical).
- **Implementation**: Producers send messages without waiting for acknowledgments (`acks=0`), and consumers commit
  offsets before processing messages.

## 2. At-Least-Once Semantics

- **Data Reliability**: High. Messages are not lost but may be duplicated.
- **Performance**: Moderate. There is additional latency due to waiting for acknowledgments and potential message
  reprocessing.
- **Use Case**: Common in many applications where ensuring message delivery is important and the system can handle or
  idempotently process duplicate messages (e.g., order processing systems).
- **Implementation**: Producers wait for broker acknowledgments (`acks=1` or `all`), and consumers commit offsets after
  processing messages. Potential for duplicates if a producer retries a message send.

## 3. Exactly-Once Semantics

- **Data Reliability**: Very High. Guarantees that each message is processed exactly once â€“ no loss, no duplicates.
- **Performance**: Lower. This approach has the highest overhead due to additional coordination for transactional
  message processing.
- **Use Case**: Essential for use cases where both message loss and duplication would cause significant issues (e.g.,
  financial transactions).
- **Implementation**: The most complex to implement. Requires idempotent producers, transactional writes, and careful
  consumer offset management.

## Comparison Table

| Semantics     | Data Loss | Duplicates | Latency/Throughput | Use Case Complexity | Typical Use Cases             |
|---------------|-----------|------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| At-Most-Once  | Possible  | No         | High/Low           | Low                 | Real-time monitoring          |
| At-Least-Once | No        | Possible   | Moderate           | Moderate            | Order processing, general use |
| Exactly-Once  | No        | No         | Low/High           | High                | Financial transactions        |

## Key Considerations

- **Trade-offs**: There is a trade-off between reliability and performance. At-most-once offers high performance but
  risks data loss, while exactly-once offers the highest reliability but at the cost of performance.
- **Application Design**: The choice of semantics often depends on the specific requirements of the application,
  particularly how it handles data duplication or loss.
- **Complexity**: Exactly-once semantics are the most complex to implement and maintain, requiring careful coordination
  between producers, brokers, and consumers.

In summary, choosing the right message delivery semantics in Kafka depends on the specific needs and tolerances of your
application regarding data integrity, performance, and complexity.
