# At Most Once Semantics

Apache Kafka's at-most-once semantics is a message delivery approach where messages are delivered at most once, meaning
messages may be lost but will not be duplicated. This approach prioritizes low latency over reliability.

## Basic Concept

- **Primary Goal**: To prevent message duplication. Each message is either delivered once or potentially not delivered
  at all.
- **Message Loss Possibility**: Due to network issues, broker failures, or consumer crashes, some messages might be
  lost.

## Implementing At-Most-Once Semantics in Kafka

1. **Producer Configuration**:
    - **Acknowledgements (ACKs)**: The producer is configured with `acks=0`, meaning it does not wait for any
      acknowledgment from the broker after sending a message.
    - **No Retries**: The producer is typically configured to not retry sending messages, to avoid the possibility of
      duplication in case of network failures or broker issues.

2. **Consumer Processing**:
    - **Offset Committing**: Consumers commit offsets before processing messages. If a consumer crashes after committing
      but before processing, the message is lost.
    - **Fast Processing**: Emphasis is on fast, non-blocking processing rather than ensuring each message is processed.

## Broker Configuration and Handling

- **Message Persistence**: Kafka still stores messages persistently on disk, but the lack of acknowledgment and retries
  from the producer increases the chance of message loss.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Reliability vs. Latency**: At-most-once semantics favor low latency over reliability. It is suitable for use cases
  where it is acceptable to lose some messages.
- **Application Logic**: The consuming application must be designed to handle the possibility of message loss.

## Use Cases

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Where receiving the most current data is more critical than ensuring every message is
  processed.
- **Streaming Data**: In scenarios where the volume of data is high and losing some messages does not significantly
  impact the overall system.

## Trade-offs

- **Throughput and Latency**: At-most-once semantics can provide higher throughput and lower latency because it
  eliminates the overhead of waiting for acknowledgments and handling retries.
- **Data Loss**: The most significant trade-off is the potential for data loss, which might not be acceptable for
  systems requiring high data reliability.

## Configuring At-Most-Once Semantics

- **Producer Configuration**: Set `acks=0` and disable retries.
- **Consumer Configuration**: Commit offsets before processing and ensure that processing does not depend on every
  message being received.

Kafka's at-most-once semantics are less commonly used than at-least-once or exactly-once semantics due to the risk of
data loss. However, it can be the right choice in scenarios where the speed of processing and low latency are the
highest priorities, and the system can tolerate losing some messages.
